/// Boot and sleep forensics.
///
/// Two things this firmware could not previously answer from the device itself:
///
///   1. Where did the last sleep stop?  A device that hangs before
///      esp_deep_sleep_start() and a device that slept fine but did not wake look
///      identical from the outside — the panel holds the sleep image either way and
///      no button does anything.  Issue #155 sat open for weeks on exactly that
///      ambiguity.
///   2. How did this boot start, and where did its time go?  The phase trace below
///      used to live as file-static state in main.cpp, reachable only over a serial
///      monitor (`CMD:BOOTLOG`) — which most reporters do not have, and which a
///      battery-powered device does not even open.
///
/// The answers are kept in three places, cheapest first:
///   * `.bss`      — this boot's phase stamps and wake verdict (26 bytes).
///   * RTC_NOINIT  — the in-flight sleep breadcrumb (12 bytes).  Survives a soft
///                   reset and a deep-sleep wake; lost whenever the rail is cut,
///                   which on an X4 sleeping with the default useClock=0 is EVERY
///                   normal sleep.  So its absence is evidence too, and the record
///                   is finalised from the reset reason in that case — see
///                   outcomeOf() and resetImpliesMcuHadStopped().
///   * SD          — a fixed-size ring of the last 16 sleep/boot events, so history
///                   survives power loss and can be read back on screen.
///
/// Surfaced by BootDiagnosticsActivity (Settings > System > Boot Diagnostics).
