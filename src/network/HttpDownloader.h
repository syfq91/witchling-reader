   *   it authenticated nothing while paying for the chain verification twice.
   *   Reaching a private-CA or self-signed server is now an explicit,
   *   user-visible choice instead of a silent per-call downgrade.
   * Strict — always verified; the skip setting does not apply. For firmware,
   *   which the device executes, so it is not the user's to downgrade.
   * Unverified — never verified: no roots loaded, no hostname check, one
   *   handshake. For public read-only data where there is no secret to leak and
   *   nothing to authenticate; also materially cheaper, since the ECDSA chain
   *   verify dominates a handshake on this chip.
