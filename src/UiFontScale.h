// The UI font ladder, and what a step up it does to layout.
//
// SMALL_FONT_ID, UI_10_FONT_ID and UI_12_FONT_ID are LOGICAL slots, not fixed faces: they are
// named after the family they carry at the DEFAULT step, and each step up SETTINGS.uiFontSize
// rebinds them one rung higher. Keeping them logical is what makes the setting a two-line
// change instead of a rename across ~600 call sites.

// Line height (EpdFontData::advanceY) of each slot at each step, indexed by
// CrossPointSettings::UI_FONT_SIZE — kept as a plain index rather than that enum so this header
// needs nothing but ThemeMetrics. UITheme.cpp static_asserts that the two stay the same length.
//
// This table exists so the layout code and the binding code read the same numbers: the metrics
// grow by the DIFFERENCE between the active step and the default one, which is only correct if
// it matches the families applyUiFontScale() actually binds. applyUiFontScale() checks the live
// fonts against this table at every bind and logs if they ever disagree, so a regenerated font
// that changes advanceY cannot silently skew every menu.

// 14 px of dead space to an 84 px header to fit 5 px of extra glyph.
//
// Deliberately NOT scaled: the reader status bar (progressBarHeight, statusBarVerticalMargin,
// batteryBarHeight) and the cover/home geometry. The status bar feeds the reader's text
// viewport, and moving the viewport invalidates every book's pagination cache — this setting is
// about hitting menu rows, not about re-laying-out books. The status bar's own text still grows
// with SMALL_FONT_ID and fits: getStatusBarItemsHeight() gives it a 31 px lane.
