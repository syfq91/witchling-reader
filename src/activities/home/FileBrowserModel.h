//
// Two interchangeable backends behind one interface. A small folder keeps its names and
// metadata in RAM and is sorted here; a folder of INDEX_THRESHOLD entries or more builds an
// SD-backed FileIndex instead, so RAM stays bounded whatever the card holds. Both present the
// same entry-name form -- a trailing '/' marks a directory -- so nothing above this class has
// to know which one is live.
//
// Deliberately free of rendering, input and activity transitions: it answers "what is in this
// directory, in what order", and leaves what a row MEANS to the activity. That is also why the
// path is set rather than walked -- computing the parent or a child path is navigation, and
