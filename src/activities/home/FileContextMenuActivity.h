// Context menu for file browser. Always shows display options (sort mode, sort
// direction, show hidden files, show extensions). When a regular file is
// selected, file-specific actions (Open, Info, Delete, ...) are appended below.
// A file the reader cannot open, which only All files lists, gets Remove and
// Move to folder.
//
// Display options are cycled inline (DynamicEnum) and the resulting state is
// returned to FileBrowserActivity when the menu closes. File actions finish the
// activity immediately with the chosen Action.
//
// Opened from the firmware picker (offerFileManagement == false) the menu keeps only what helps
// pick an image: sorting, searching, and removing an old .bin. Organising the card -- new folders,
// moving files, deleting folders -- is the library browser's business, not the updater's.
