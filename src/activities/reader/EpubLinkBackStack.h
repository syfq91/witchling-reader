// The EPUB reader's link Back stack: where each followed link (footnote or not) was tapped, newest
// last, so Back returns there instead of closing the book. Kept beside progress.bin as
// linkstack.bin, little-endian:
//   version(1) depth(1) then depth x [spine(2) page(2) pageCount(2) paragraph(2)]
//
// It is persisted so a stack survives sleep and a reopen: the reader reopens on the page it was
// showing, which for a followed link is the destination, and without the stack Back on it closed
// the book. An entry keeps the whole position the reader recorded -- paragraph anchor and page
// count as well as the page -- and is restored by the same path as one that never left memory
// (EpubReaderActivity::restoreSavedPosition): through the paragraph, else the page rescaled by the
// page count. So a stack saved under one layout still finds its place after a font or settings
// change, or under a firmware whose section layout version moved.
//
// Ported from crosspoint-reader PR #3764 ("fix: reopen on the viewed page after following a link",
// suhsoohong / @suhsoohong): theirs is the idea of persisting the stack and the rule that a full
// stack drops its oldest entry. Their file holds spine and page only; this one also carries the
// paragraph anchor and page count, and is not consumed on open (see linkStackOnDisk_).
