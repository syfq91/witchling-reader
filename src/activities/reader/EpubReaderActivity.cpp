// The reader path has ~8 free/contig floors (PRE_RENDER_, BG_BUILD_*, IN_PLACE_BUILD_*,
// RESIDENT_BUILD_ABORT_*) that predate the build arena. Several of them REJECT SILENTLY, so a
// device trace cannot show which floor sent a build down the released path — and the released
// path is where the X3 fragmented-heap restart happens. Device-measured example (X4):
//
//   heapAllowsInPlaceBuild=0 css=1 ring=15799 free=71544(floor=83383) contig=59380(floor=32768)
//
// contig passes with 26 KB to spare; `free` fails against a floor that is UNREACHABLE (post-font
// free peaks at ~97 KB and is ~71 KB by reader time), because the floor added ringBytes on top of
// a base already sized for the working set. Meanwhile the arena serves every build with
// failedAlloc=0 at ~30 KB high-water. One line per gate, so one trace shows every decision and
// the arithmetic behind it.
//
// RESOLVED for that gate (2026-08-15): heapAllowsInPlaceBuild now takes max(parse, extract+ring)
// instead of parse+ring — see the derivation there, and the X4 trace that measured it.
//
// STILL UNREACHABLE, deliberately not touched in the same change: the two Background-B
// heap-backed gates. Same X4 trace, ~20 evaluations across one reading session:
//   gate=bgB_waitheap     REJECT free=~57000(floor=63488) contig=25588(floor=40960)
//   gate=bgB_cssResident  REJECT free=~56500(floor=73728) contig=25588(floor=0)

// (BG_BUILD_BORROW_*, 40960/12288) are reachable and are what it actually uses — so these two
// only bind when there is no buffer to lend, and then they refuse unconditionally. Re-deriving
// them wants its own measurement of a heap-backed B build, which this device cannot produce
// while the borrow keeps succeeding.
//
