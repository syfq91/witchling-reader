// What a tap on a list row means, given where the selection already is.
//
// apply() implements the safer point-then-confirm rule: the first tap on a row MOVES the
// selection there and stops; only a tap on the row that is already selected runs the action.
// ActivationState applies the user's tap preference without confusing keyboard focus with a
// preceding tap. In two-step mode the first tap always arms the row; only the next tap on that
// same, still-selected row activates it.
//
// This replaces an earlier single-tap-activates design. The argument against two-step then was
// that it cost two panel refreshes per action, but that measured the wrong thing: it was one
// *contact* producing both a held-move and a release-activate, i.e. two refreshes for one
// gesture. Here each refresh belongs to its own deliberate tap, and the first one is the
// feedback — which on e-paper is the only feedback available until a localised tap-flash
// exists (P2 in docs/touch-input-migration-2026-08-14.md).
//
// Kept free of Activity so the rule is exercised on the host: this is a state machine about
// selection, and every screen in the firmware routes its taps through it.

  // Not a row this screen can act on right now — out of range, a separator, a screen whose
  // state has moved on since the render that recorded the band. The tap is consumed but inert.
  Rejected,
  // The selection moved here. Repaint; do NOT activate.
  Selected,
  // The finger landed on the row that was already selected. Activate it.
