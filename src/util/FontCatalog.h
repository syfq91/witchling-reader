// The font manifest's families, their files and every string they hold, in ONE heap block of exactly
// the size they need. The Font Manager keeps the list while the user browses it and frees it before a
// download. As a vector of families -- two std::strings and a vector of files each, a std::string per
// file -- it was about 300 small allocations (19 KB on an X3), interleaved with whatever else allocated
// meanwhile. Freeing them gave the bytes back but not a block big enough for wolfSSL's 16.7 KB TLS
// record, and the download failed. One block comes back in one piece.
//
// Layout, in the host's byte order (a stash never leaves the device that wrote it):
//
//   header   16 bytes   u32 magic 'CPFC', u16 version, u16 families, u16 files, u16 stringBytes,
//                       u32 blockBytes (the whole block, header included)
//   families 12 bytes   u32 totalSize, u16 name, u16 description, u16 firstFile, u8 flags, u8 0
//   files    12 bytes   u32 size, u32 crc32, u16 name, u8 hasCrc32, u8 0
//   strings             every string NUL-terminated; name and description fields are offsets here
//
// A family's files run from its firstFile to the next family's (or to the end). The 16-bit counts
// and offsets bound a catalog at 65535 families, files and string bytes: a block that size would
// never be allocated on the C3 in the first place.
//
// Built by a Builder in two passes over the same events: one counts, then one fills a block allocated
// for exactly that count. Read by index; the strings are const char* into the block, valid until the
// catalog is cleared, replaced or destroyed. Only the three per-family flags change after the build.
// An index out of range reads as "" / 0 / false, and setting a flag on one does nothing.
