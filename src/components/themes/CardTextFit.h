// How many lines each part of a home card's text block gets, so the block fits its tile.
//
// The card stacks a title, author, series, a status line and the reading history, each wrapped
// to its own cap. Nothing compared the sum with the tile: a long title, a list of co-authors and
// a long series name each took their full cap, the block outgrew the tile, and centring it put
// the title above the selection highlight and the status line below it (#375).
//
// Pure arithmetic over line counts, with no renderer dependency, so the order in which the parts
// give way is pinned on the host. The caller wraps each part at its cap, passes the line counts
// in, and re-wraps only the parts whose count came back smaller: wrappedText() ellipsizes the
// last line it is allowed, so a shortened part still says it was cut.
