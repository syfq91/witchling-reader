// Geometry for a paged grid of book covers (the recent-books cover view).
//
// Nothing here is a fixed column or row count: both fall out of the space the caller hands in, so
// a higher-resolution panel yields MORE cells of the same comfortable size rather than the same
// few cells blown up. The caller supplies the content area it has after the header and button
// hints, plus the largest cover box worth drawing -- the full-size thumbnail's, since the draw path
// never upscales and a bigger box would only add empty frame.
//
// Rows come first, at full size. A page that would leave at least half a row empty takes one more
// row instead, its cells shrunk to fit (on a 540x960 panel: three rows of ~210 px covers rather
// than two rows of 240 and a fifth of the screen blank). Columns then follow from how wide a
// cover is at that height. The thumbnail is made at the cell's size (thumbWidth x thumbHeight), so
// a cover always draws 1:1: a dithered 1-bit image must never be resampled.
//
// Pure arithmetic: no renderer, no theme, no storage, so it is exercised on the host.

// carousel does, cut a third off the top and bottom of every ordinary cover.
//
// A grid makes its thumbnail at the size its cells come out at (Layout::thumbWidth x thumbHeight),
