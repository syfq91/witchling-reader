ButtonEventManager& globalButtonEvents();

// Classifies raw button edges into Short, Double, and Long press events.
//
// Edges are produced by the background sampler (HalGPIO) and queued with the
// millis() timestamp at which they were detected. update() drains that queue and
// drives a per-button state machine from each discrete edge, so a complete tap
// that began and ended while the loop task was busy (a single drained edge pair)
// is still classified correctly. The key latency rule:
//   - If no double-click action is configured for a button, Short fires immediately
//     on release (zero extra wait).
//   - If a double-click action IS configured, Short is delayed by DOUBLE_WINDOW_MS
//     to allow disambiguation.
//   - Long fires as soon as hold time >= LONG_PRESS_MS; release is not required.
//   - Double fires on the second release within DOUBLE_WINDOW_MS.
//
// Activities query consumeEvent() each loop tick to receive pending events.
// drain() resets all state machines — call it on activity transitions.
//
// Aliased buttons: Up/PageBack and Down/PageForward are two logical names for the
// SAME physical side button (see MappedInputManager::rawIndex). Each name runs its
// own FSM, so one press emits one event per name — by design, so list-style
// activities can match Up/Down while readers match PageBack/PageForward. An activity
// must therefore accept only ONE name per pair in a given condition, or it will
// handle the same press twice.
