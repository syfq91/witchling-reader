PlatformIO pre-build hook: apply the SdFat patches in scripts/sdfat_patches/ to the
SdFat copy this env builds (.pio/libdeps/<env>/SdFat).

Ported from crosspoint-reader PR #3685 ("perf: keep FAT sectors in a separate SdFat
cache", Sung-jin Brian Hong / @serialx). The two patches are theirs, verbatim:

  0001  FsCache: invalidate the cache after a failed sector read. With SHARED_SPI
        (how every SPI board here mounts the card), SdSpiCard::readSectors() fills
        the cache buffer and only then sends CMD12; if CMD12 fails, the cache still
        names the previous sector while holding the new one's bytes. A later
        CACHE_FOR_WRITE of that sector writes those bytes back -- to both FAT copies
        when it is a FAT sector.
  0002  SdFatConfig: let -DUSE_SEPARATE_FAT_CACHE=1 (platformio.ini) override the
        ARM-only default, so FAT lookups stop evicting the file/directory sector.

One more is OURS, not upstream's (see its header):

  0003  FatPartition: with the separate FAT cache, sync the FAT before the
        directory sector, the order the single shared cache gave by eviction, so a
        power cut mid-sync cannot leave an entry pointing at clusters the FAT
        still marks free.

Their safety gates come along too: SdFat must be exactly the release the patches were
reviewed against, and every file a patch touches must hash to that release's bytes or
to the reviewed patched bytes. Everything is checked before anything is written, and
an already-patched file is left untouched so incremental builds recompile nothing.
Bumping SdFat therefore means re-reviewing every patch and re-deriving PATCHES.

What differs from upstream:
  * A pre: hook that looks the copy up in this env's libdeps dir, in the shape of
    patch_uzlib.py / patch_wolfssl.py, rather than a post: hook walking the
    resolved lib builders. PlatformIO installs lib_deps before it starts SCons, so
    the copy is already there; and running before pioarduino's SDK-only pass
    blanks lib_deps means that pass needs no special case. A second, detached copy
    (SdFat@x.y.z) fails the build, since which one gets compiled is then a guess.
  * Line endings. The patch text is normalised to LF and handed to git on stdin: a
    Windows checkout under core.autocrlf=true has CRLF .patch files, which do not
    apply to the LF registry sources. And git runs with system/global config off
    and core.autocrlf=false, or Git for Windows' system-wide autocrlf plus SdFat's
    own `* text=auto` .gitattributes rewrite the WHOLE patched file as CRLF. Both
    were reproduced on Windows; the hash gate is what catches the second.
  * The set of .patch files must match PATCHES exactly, so a new patch cannot be
    dropped in without its hashes and silently skipped.

Runs as a PlatformIO pre: hook and standalone:
  python scripts/patch_sdfat.py              # every .pio/libdeps/*/SdFat
  python scripts/patch_sdfat.py DIR [DIR..]  # the given SdFat directories
