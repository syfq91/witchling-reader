// Streams printed-page entries (href, anchor, label) directly to pagelist.bin
// instead of buffering them in a std::vector. Buffering blows the X3 heap on
// books with long EPUB 3 <nav epub:type="page-list"> sections (a few hundred
// entries × 3 std::string each is enough to throw std::bad_alloc).
//
// File format matches the legacy writePageListBin() in Epub.cpp so the reader
// side (Epub::streamPrintedPageEntries) is unchanged: u16 count, then per entry
// writeString(href), writeString(anchor), writeString(label).
//
// Lifecycle: construct (opens the file and writes a placeholder count of 0),
// addEntry(...) for each parsed entry, then finalize() to seek back and patch
// the real count. If no entries were added, finalize() removes the file —
// matching the legacy writer's "remove on empty" behaviour so subsequent
// fallback parsers (NCX after nav, page-map after both) see no stale file.
//
// Not copyable; not thread-safe (each book parse is single-threaded).
