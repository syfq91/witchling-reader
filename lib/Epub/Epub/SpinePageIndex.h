// How many pages each spine item lays out to under one set of render settings, kept on SD at
// `<book cache>/pages.bin` so the reader can count a chapter split over several spine items
// (#325) without holding a per-spine table in RAM (books with 1700+ spine items exist) and
// without opening each sibling's section cache: every FAT open scans its directory linearly, so a
// chapter of N files would cost N directory walks. Summing a chapter here is one open in the book
// cache root plus one sequential read of 6 bytes per spine item.
//
// One render variant at a time: recording under another (font, margins, a section layout
// version bump) starts the table over, since the old counts describe nothing the reader shows.
// An entry is a fact about a deterministic layout, so it stays right when its section cache is
// evicted: a rebuild under the same variant lays out the same pages.
