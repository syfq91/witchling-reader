// Incremental, persisted image-dimension cache. The book is NOT scanned up front: the
// manifest starts from whatever images.bin holds (possibly empty) and grows one image at a
// time via resolve() as section indexing first encounters each image. Each image's header is
// therefore read at most once in the book's lifetime; nothing is held resident for images you
// never reach. (Eagerly building the whole thing cost tens of seconds and shredded the heap on
// image-heavy books — see git history.)
//
// Sized for a large number of images. Everything per image is fixed-size and small, and nothing
// in memory has a cap that would fail silently past it:
//   - a resolved image is a 12-byte record (64-bit FNV-1a of its normalised entry path, width,
//     height) in one sorted array; 1,000 images are 12 KB, not 1,000 path strings on the heap.
//     The array grows nothrow: when the heap cannot grow it, the image is still answered for
//     this build, it just is not remembered.
//   - an image whose header lies beyond the probe window (Photoshop-style exports: 10-29 KB of
//     Exif/IPTC/XMP/ICC before SOF) waits in images.pending on the card -- key + ZIP stat, 22 B
//     each, unbounded -- for the streaming walk. That queue survives a reboot, which is exactly
//     when a fresh heap makes the walk possible. It used to be an in-memory queue of 16; past
//     that, images were laid out as alt text with no retry.
