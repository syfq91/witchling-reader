// Source file size above which an image is considered "large" and rendered as a placeholder
// until the user explicitly requests it.
//
// This used to be a PIXEL area (800*600), compared against ImageBlock's width/height — which are
// the DISPLAY dimensions, not the source's. On a 480x800 panel the largest image that can be
// drawn covers 384000 pixels, so the test could never be true and the placeholder never appeared,
// whatever the setting said. Bytes also happen to be the better predictor: what costs seconds is
// pulling the entry out of the ZIP and inflating it, and that scales with the file, not with the
// area it ends up occupying on screen.
//
// 256 KB, from device measurements on X4: Men at Arms' 857182-byte cover PNG cost ~17 s to
// extract plus ~5.8 s per decode pass, while the same book's 113588-byte and 155096-byte JPEGs
// are unremarkable. The line wants to sit above the second group and well below the first.
//
// Note what this does NOT cover: a small file that inflates to an enormous bitmap (a flat-colour
// 5000x5000 PNG) is cheap to read and slow to decode, and nothing here sees that. Source pixel
// dimensions are known at parse time but are not carried on the block; if such a book turns up,
// that is the axis to add rather than moving this number.

// pass (see Section::warmAllImageCaches).
//
// Each decode otherwise takes and returns its own large blocks — a 32 KB inflate ring (PNG) or
// a 12 KB work pool (JPEG), plus scanline buffers — and nothing is reused between images. A
// warm pass decoding N images therefore performs N rounds of that churn, which on a
// no-compaction heap breaks up the contiguous region a later framebuffer realloc needs. See
// docs/memory-allocation-strategy.md (rule 4) and the crash it explains.
//
// A global rather than a parameter because the arena has to reach decoders several layers down
// (Section -> Page -> ImageBlock -> converter -> PngStreamDecoder) through interfaces shared
// with callers that have no arena. Decoders fall back to the heap when none is installed, so
// this is an optimisation, never a requirement.

// headroom, so with an arena installed it demands 12 KB of heap for a block the heap never
// sees, and refuses decodes the heap could easily serve.
//
// Mirrors what the allocators actually do (they bump-allocate and fall back to the heap on
// refusal), including worst-case alignment padding. An over-optimistic answer degrades to a
// heap fallback inside the decoder, which is already handled — it cannot crash.
