// FontSizeLadder — the body font's sibling sizes, used to snap an effective block
// font size to a REAL pre-rendered font instead of nearest-neighbor glyph scaling
// (concept from CidVonHighwind/microreader's BitmapFontSet).
//
// The app layer builds the ladder (it knows the font family and which built-in
// sizes exist) and passes it down as pure data so the Epub lib stays
// settings-agnostic — the same contract the old HeadingFonts struct had.
// Each rung is a registered fontId plus its size as a percent of the body font
// (the body font itself is the 100% rung). SD-card fonts ship a single loaded
// size, so their ladder is empty and everything resolves to the scale fallback
// (their body ID may itself carry a base scale when the card lacks the chosen
// size -- SdCardFontManager::ensureSizeAlias -- which compounds like any other).
//
// Deterministic from the body fontId by construction, so it is deliberately NOT
// part of the section-cache property hash (fontId already is). That holds WITHIN a
// firmware version and not across one: adding or removing a rung changes which face
// a heading resolves to for an unchanged body fontId, so the hash still matches a
// cache laid out by the old ladder. Changing the shipped rungs is therefore a cache
// format change and MUST bump SECTION_FILE_VERSION -- adding 20/22/24/26 pt did.
// Some rungs have no face of their own: 22/24/26 pt render the 20 pt master scaled (see
// GfxRenderer::insertScaledFont). This struct does not need to know which, and that is worth
// stating because an earlier note here said the opposite.
//
// The worry was double resampling: resolve() landing on a synthesised rung and then applying a
// residual on top, scaling an already-scaled glyph. That would be real if the scale lived in the
// glyph data. It lives on the FONT ID instead, and GfxRenderer compounds it with whatever residual
// the caller passes -- drawTextScaled(id24, ..., 1.1f) is ONE resample of the 20 pt master at
// 1.2 x 1.1, never a resample of a resample. So a synthesised rung is as good a source as a real
// one, resolve() can treat every rung alike, and no per-rung flag is needed.
//
// What does still hold: the rung's sizePct is the rung's nominal size, so the residual resolve()
// hands back is correct whether the rung is real or scaled. And kMaxRungs is a CAPACITY, not a
// description of the shipped set -- see the note on it.
struct FontSizeLadder {
  // Capacity, not a description of the shipped set -- naming the sizes here is what let this go
  // stale. addRung() drops anything past it SILENTLY, so a family that grew a size simply lost
  // its largest rung and every heading that wanted it resampled from a smaller face instead.
  // Exactly that happened when the 24 pt rung was added. The app asserts its own ladder fits
  // (see buildReaderFontSizeLadder), which is the check that would have caught it.
