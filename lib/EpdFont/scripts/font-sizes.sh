# The one list of built-in font sizes.

# Sourced by convert-builtin-fonts.sh, which generates the faces, and by
# build-font-ids.sh, which hashes each face set into the ID the renderer keys on.
# Keeping it here means a size cannot exist in one and not the other -- the ID
# script used to be unrolled per size by hand and silently fell behind.
#
# Changing a size here is half the job: the point size these map to lives in
# CrossPointSettings::FONT_SIZE_RUNGS, and the generated headers are referenced by
# name from builtinFonts/all.h, main.cpp and CrossPointSettings.cpp.

# keeps asking for the same two IDs whatever the setting says.
