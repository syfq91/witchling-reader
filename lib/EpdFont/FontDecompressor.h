  // Largest packed single glyph the per-glyph fallback cache can serve, and so the largest a

  // largest is 513 bytes (bookerly_18_bolditalic, 54x38) and the next is 507 — so the previous
  // 512 refused exactly one glyph, by one byte, and it rendered blank on every page whose
  // prewarm missed it. 576 clears the corpus with headroom.
  //
  // Not free: this is .bss multiplied by FALLBACK_CACHE_SLOTS, i.e. 256 bytes off the heap
  // ceiling (see the sizing note there). That is why it is not simply set to something generous.
  // fontconvert.py mirrors this constant and refuses to generate a font that would overflow it,
  // so the next oversized glyph is a build error rather than an invisible blank; the host test
  // checks the shipped fonts against it from the other side.
  // 640, raised from 576 to admit the 20 pt reader faces. The binding glyph is U+01C4 (DZ
  // digraph) in bookerly_20_bolditalic at 60x41, which packs to 615 bytes; 640 is the next
  // multiple of 64 above it.
  //
  // The cap is set by the widest glyph in the whole coverage, not by anything a reader meets --
  // that digraph appears in Serbo-Croatian and essentially nowhere else, and at 18 pt it was the
  // blocker too. Costs FALLBACK_CACHE_SLOTS x 64 = 256 B of .bss, which buys a larger reader
  // font for people who cannot read 18 pt.
  //
  // Measured, not guessed: an earlier attempt at this constant was set from a 22 pt probe and was
