// WitchReader SecureNet — HTTP Range helpers for bounded (chunked) downloads.
//
// Why: wolfSSL reads each TLS record into one heap buffer of the record's length, and a server may
// send records of up to 16 KB. On the C3 that is a 17,408 B block (TLSF rounds a 16,401 B request up
// to its size class), which a network session on the X3 does not have once the handshake and the
// Wi-Fi receive buffers have taken their share. A Range request for C bytes bounds the response, and
// with it every record, to C plus the response headers: the server cannot send more than that.
// GitHub's raw CDN, for example, sends 16 KB records once a connection has carried ~56 KB, but an
// 8 KB range arrives as one 8,209 B record (measured with openssl -trace, 2026-10-05).
//
// Pure functions, no Arduino: host-tested in test/http_range.
