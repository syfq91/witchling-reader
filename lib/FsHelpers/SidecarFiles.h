// Sidecar files: companions sitting beside a book, sharing its name with a
// different extension. The firmware prefers them over the equivalent data
// embedded in the book, so "Some Book.jpg" overrides its cover and
// "Some Book.opf" overrides its metadata (see docs/sidecar-files.md).
//
// This is the single definition of what counts as a sidecar. It used to be
// spread across multiple places - the cover resolver, the metadata resolver
// and file move routines - which is how .opf came to be readable by the
// reader but left behind when a book moved.
//
// ADDING A NEW KIND OF SIDECAR MEANS ADDING IT HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE.
