// Serializes display-controller access and, on SPI-SD boards, access to the
// physical SPI bus shared by the e-ink panel and the SD card.
//
// The two devices share the physical bus (see SPI_MISO in HalGPIO.h, "shared
// between SD card and display"). HalStorage already serializes SD access with
// storageMutex, but HalDisplay took no lock at all, and the two run on
// different tasks: the render task drives the panel from
// ActivityManager::renderTaskLoop(), while the main task runs
// currentActivity->loop() *without* the render lock (deliberately - see the
// note in ActivityManager::loop()). Many activities do SD I/O from loop().
//
// A display refresh interleaving with a concurrent SD transfer can therefore
// confuse SdSpiCard's unsynchronised m_spiActive state machine, surfacing as
// corrupted reads or a FreeRTOS panic - a signature easily misfiled as heap
// corruption.
//
// Lock ordering is SPI-outer, storage-inner: on SPI-SD boards,
// HalStorage::StorageLock acquires this lock as its outermost member
// (construction order guarantees it), and display code takes only this lock,
// so the global order is consistent and deadlock-free. Native-SDMMC boards do
// not take this lock for storage operations.
//
// The mutex is recursive so a storage path that re-enters the bus lock cannot
// self-deadlock. HalStorage's own mutex is recursive as well because replacing
// a HalFile while already inside StorageLock destroys its previous SdFat handle
// and that implicit close must remain serialized.
