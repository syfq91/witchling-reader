// Full decoder for progressive (SOF2) JPEGs: grayscale (luma) output at 1/1, 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8
// scale, streamed top to bottom in bands, without a whole-image coefficient buffer.
//
// A progressive file stores the picture as a sequence of scans, each a pass over the whole image
// that refines some coefficients. Decoding in bands therefore needs every scan to be positioned
// at the band's first block at once. One pass over the file indexes the scans; after that each
// scan gets a resumable cursor (file offset, bit buffer, EOB run, DC predictors, restart state)
// and a band is decoded by advancing every luma scan across it in file order. The file is still
// read about once in total; the working set is one band of coefficients.
//
// Only the coefficients the output scale needs are kept (the top-left 8/2^s square of each
// block) and inverted with an n-point IDCT -- libjpeg's reduced-size decoding: a proper low-pass
// resample of the block, sharper and with less aliasing than a box average of the full decode.
// Successive-approximation refinement needs to know which coefficients are non-zero across the
// WHOLE block, so a 64-bit mask per block tracks that for the ones not kept.
//
// Chroma is decoded only where the bitstream forces it (interleaved DC scans) and discarded.
