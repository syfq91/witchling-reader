# Witch(hunt) Reader

This firmware is a streamlined fork based on [jpirnay/witchhunt-reader](https://github.com/jpirnay/witchhunt-reader) (originally derived from [crosspoint-reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader) by Dave Allie and others).

**Caveat: new hardware batches of the X3 / X4 from xteink seem to come with a newer display panels. These models should work with Witch(hunt) Reader from version 2.21 onwards.**

## Changes from `jpirnay/witchhunt-reader`

This fork focuses on a lighter, more reliable, and standardized reading experience by streamlining network protocols and removing non-essential background features in favor of open standards:

- **Removed Weather Integration**: Removed the Open-Meteo weather client, home screen weather widget, weather icon sets, settings, and background polling to conserve RAM and reduce battery drain.
- **Removed Calibre Wireless Device Transfer**: Dropped the proprietary Calibre SmartDevice wireless protocol in favor of standard OPDS library catalog browsing and browser-based file management.
- **Removed USB Serial File Transfer**: Stripped the custom USB-CDC serial transfer protocol and host scripts, keeping serial strictly for logging and diagnostics.
- **Removed Legacy KOReader Synchronization**: Removed the legacy KOReader sync client, XPath indexing/mapping engines, credential stores, and sync screens (preparing for modern OPDS Progression 1.0 synchronization).
- **Decoupled Document ID & Reading Stats**: Replaced KOReader document hash generation with a lightweight, standalone `calculateBookId` helper in Reading Stats to preserve reading history, pace tracking, and cover caches.
- **Reduced Memory & Flash Footprint**: Eliminated over 8,000 lines of unused networking and transfer code, removed redundant background tasks, and stripped unused translation keys across all 24 supported languages.

# Installation

Flashing is done from the browser — no toolchain or driver install needed. Use a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera) or a recent Firefox version (>151); older versions of Firefox and Safari do not support WebSerial.

1. Download `firmware.bin` for your device from the [latest release](../../releases/latest).
2. Open the [CrossPoint flash tools](https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools).
3. Pick your device (X3 or X4).
4. Choose **Custom .bin** and upload the `firmware.bin` you downloaded in step 1.
5. Connect the device via USB and start the flash — pick the device's serial port when the browser asks. 

# What this reader doesn't
* Great UI design is not necessarily/obviously not a forte of mine, so if you look for a polished look and feel, I would recommend going e.g. to [CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/crossink), a great piece of work by uxJulia
* Support for CJK (Chinese Japanese Korean) - look at https://github.com/aBER0724/crosspoint-reader-cjk
* Right-to-left rendering support (Hebrew, Arabic) - choose the original [CrossPoint](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader) firmware
* The most memory efficient reader might still be [MicroReader](https://github.com/CidVonHighwind/microreader) by CidVonHighwind

All of them have their strengths and constraints (as has Witch reader), so they deserve a testrun before you decide which one is right for you


# Feature comparison with CrossPoint

A feature-by-feature comparison of **Witch Reader** against its ancestor,
**[CrossPoint Reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader)**, focused on what
a user actually sees and does on the device.

> **Snapshot of 2026-06-19.** Both projects are under active and dynamic development, so individual
> rows may change quickly — treat this as a point-in-time picture rather than a guarantee. The
> entries were verified against the current source of both projects rather than commit history,
> since the two have effectively diverged.

## At a glance

**Choose Witch Reader for:** speed, richer CSS and typography (floats, real tables, small-caps,
strikethrough, line-height), GIF and better image handling, Markdown, a clock on
the X4, reading statistics, global bookmarks, a cover carousel, fully customizable per-button
gestures, and a deeper settings/system surface.

**Choose CrossPoint for:** right-to-left languages (Hebrew / Arabic) — the one user-facing
capability Witch Reader genuinely lacks — plus  a
couple of small browser-navigation conveniences. It is also the leaner, simpler codebase.

1) Apologies for the poor image quality of the microreader screenshots, i needed to make photos with my mobile, as I couldn't figure out how to create screenshots from within the reader
   
2) The Rendering of the Mouse poem in MicroReader is even more refined, it manages to deal with different font sizes, too
