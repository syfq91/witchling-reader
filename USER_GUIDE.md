## 1. Hardware Overview

The device utilises the standard buttons on the Xteink X4 (in the same layout as the manufacturer firmware, by default):

### Button Layout
| Location        | Buttons                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bottom Edge** | **Back**, **Confirm**, **Left**, **Right**           |
| **Right Side**  | **Power**, **Volume Up**, **Volume Down**, **Reset** |

Button layout can be customized in the **[Controls Settings](#373-controls)**.

### Taking a Screenshot
When the Power Button and Volume Down button are pressed at the same time, it will take a screenshot and save it in the folder `screenshots/`.

Alternatively, while reading a book, press the **Confirm** button to open the reader menu and select **Take screenshot**.

---

## 2. Power & Startup

### Power On / Off

To turn the device on or off, **press and hold the Power button for approximately half a second**.
In the **[Controls Settings](#373-controls)** you can configure the power button to turn the device off with a short press instead of a long one.

To reboot the device (for example after a firmware update or if it's frozen), press and release the Reset button, and then quickly press and hold the Power button for a few seconds.

### First Launch

Upon turning the device on for the first time, you will be placed on the **[Home](#31-home-screen)** screen.

> [!NOTE]
> On subsequent restarts, the firmware will automatically reopen the last book you were reading.

---

## 3. Screens

### 3.1 Home Screen

The Home screen is the main entry point to the firmware. It shows the most recently read book as a cover thumbnail and provides navigation to **[Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode)**, the **[Browse Files](#33-browse-files-screen)** screen, the **[Recent Books](#34-recent-books-screen)** screen, the **[File Transfer](#36-file-transfer-screen)** screen, and **[Settings](#37-settings)**. A clock is also accessible from the Home screen when configured.

### 3.2 Reading Mode

See [Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode) below for more information.

### 3.3 Browse Files Screen

The Browse Files screen is a full-featured file and folder browser.

* **Navigate List:** Use **Left** (or **Volume Up**), or **Right** (or **Volume Down**) to move the selection cursor up and down through folders and books. Long-pressing these buttons scrolls a full page at a time.
* **Open Selection:** Press **Confirm** to open a folder or read a selected book.
* **Context Menu:** Hold and release **Confirm** to open a context menu for the selected item. Actions include: open, mark as read, view book info, set as sleep screen, flash a `.bin` firmware file, and delete.

#### Sorting

Files and folders can be sorted by **name**, **date**, **size**, or **type**, in either ascending or descending order. The sort order is configurable from the context menu or a dedicated sort button in the browser toolbar.

#### Large folders

Folders with many entries are handled via an SD-card-backed index so memory use stays bounded regardless of folder size.

### 3.4 Recent Books Screen

The Recent Books screen shows recently opened books as a **cover grid**, displaying cover art, title, and author. Selecting a book opens it at the last read position.

### 3.5 Book Info Screen

The Book Info screen shows full metadata for a book: cover image, title, author, description (paged if long), and reading statistics. It is accessible from the context menu in Browse Files or from the reader menu while reading.

### 3.6 File Transfer Screen

The File Transfer screen allows you to upload new e-books to the device. When you enter the screen, you'll be prompted with a WiFi selection dialog and then your X4 will start hosting a web server.

See the [webserver docs](./docs/webserver.md) for more information on how to connect to the web server and upload files.

> [!TIP]
> Advanced users can also manage files programmatically or via the command line using `curl`. See the [webserver docs](./docs/webserver.md) for details.

#### 3.7.5 OPDS Servers (Multiple Libraries)

Witch Reader supports saving multiple OPDS servers and switching between them when browsing catalogs.

1. Open **Settings -> System -> OPDS Servers**.
2. Select **Add Server** to create a new entry, or select an existing server to edit it.
3. Configure these fields:
   - **Server Name**: Optional display name (for example, "Home Calibre" or "Public Catalog").
   - **OPDS Server URL**: Full catalog root URL (for Calibre Content Server, usually ends with `/opds`).
   - **Username / Password**: Optional credentials for authenticated servers.
4. Use **Delete Server** inside a server entry to remove it.

Behavior notes:

- You can store up to 8 OPDS servers.
- OPDS authentication supports HTTP Basic auth. If you use Calibre Content Server with authentication enabled, set it to Basic (not Digest).

You can also manage OPDS servers from the web interface while in File Transfer mode:

1. Connect to the device web UI.
2. Open `http://<device-ip>/settings`.
3. Use the **OPDS Servers** card to add, edit, or delete entries.
For web-based WiFi network management, see [Web Settings (WiFi + OPDS)](#376-web-settings-wifi--opds).

#### 3.7.6 Web Settings (WiFi + OPDS)

While in **File Transfer** mode, the web settings page includes management cards for both **WiFi Networks** and **OPDS Servers**.

1. On device: open **File Transfer** and connect to WiFi.
1. In a browser, open `http://<device-ip>/settings` or `http://witchhunt.local`.
1. In **WiFi Networks**, add, edit, or delete saved network entries (SSID + optional password).
1. In **OPDS Servers**, add, edit, or delete OPDS catalogs.

Behavior notes:

- Passwords are never shown back in the web UI after saving.
- Leaving Password blank while editing keeps the existing saved password unchanged.
- The web UI can save hidden-network SSIDs, but connecting to hidden networks still depends on device-side WiFi connection flow.

#### 3.7.7 KOReader Sync Quick Setup

Witch Reader can sync reading progress with KOReader-compatible sync servers automatically and bidirectionally. It also interoperates with KOReader apps/devices when they use the same server and credentials.

##### Option A: Free Public Server (`sync.koreader.rocks`)

1. Go to **Settings → System → KOReader Sync**.
2. Set **Sync Server URL** to `https://sync.koreader.rocks` (or leave it empty — the default points to the same server).
3. Enter your **Username** and **Password**.
4. Select **Register** to create a new account on the server — Witch Reader handles the registration on-device, including the required MD5 password hashing. If the username is already taken, choose a different one and try again.
5. Once registration succeeds, select **Authenticate** to confirm the credentials are working.

Already have KOReader Sync credentials? Skip **Register** and go straight to **Authenticate**.

##### Option B: Self-Hosted Server (Docker Compose)

1. Start a sync server on your computer or home server:

```bash
mkdir -p kosync-quickstart && cd kosync-quickstart

cat > compose.yaml <<'YAML'
services:
  kosync:
    image: koreader/kosync:latest
    ports:
      - "7200:7200"
      - "17200:17200"
    volumes:
      - ./data/redis:/var/lib/redis
    environment:
      - ENABLE_USER_REGISTRATION=true
    restart: unless-stopped
YAML

docker compose up -d
```

> [!NOTE]
> Set `ENABLE_USER_REGISTRATION=false` after creating your accounts to prevent unexpected registrations.

2. On the device, go to **Settings → System → KOReader Sync**:
   - Set **Sync Server URL** to `http://<server-ip>:17200` (or `https://<server-ip>:7200` for the TLS listener).
   - Enter your **Username** and **Password**.
   - Select **Register** to create the account directly from the device.
   - Select **Authenticate** to confirm.

##### Using sync while reading

Press **Confirm** to open the reader menu, then select **Sync Progress**:
- **Apply Remote** — jump to the progress stored on the server.
- **Upload Local** — push the current position to the server.

### 3.8 Sleep Screen

The **Sleep Screen** setting controls what is displayed when the device goes to sleep:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Dark** (default) | The Witch Reader logo on a dark background. |
| **Light** | The Witch Reader logo on a white background. |
| **Custom** | A custom image from the SD card (see below). Falls back to **Dark** if no custom image is found. |
| **Cover** | The cover of the currently open book. Falls back to **Dark** if no book is open. |
| **Cover + Custom** | The cover of the currently open book. Falls back to **Custom** behavior if no book is open. |
| **Page Overlay** | A transparent PNG composited over the current reader page — book content shows through the alpha channel. |
| **Quick Resume** | A minimal screen; waking the device returns to reading immediately. |
| **None** | A blank screen. |

The **Sleep Image Pick Mode** setting controls whether custom images are chosen **randomly** or **sequentially**.

An optional **tint overlay** (Off / White / Gray / Black) can be applied on top of the sleep image to dim or tint it.

#### Cover settings

When using **Cover** or **Cover + Custom**, two additional settings apply:

- **Sleep Screen Cover Mode**: **Fit** (scale to fit, white borders) or **Crop** (scale and crop to fill the screen).
- **Sleep Screen Cover Filter**: **None** (grayscale), **Contrast** (black & white), or **Inverted** (inverted black & white).

#### Custom images

To use custom sleep images, set the sleep screen mode to **Custom** or **Cover + Custom**, then place images on the SD card:

- **Multiple Images (recommended):** Create a `.sleep` directory in the root of the SD card and place any number of `.bmp` or `.png` images inside. (A directory named `sleep` is also accepted as a fallback.)
- **Single Image:** Place a file named `sleep.bmp` in the root directory. Used as fallback if no valid images are found in the `.sleep`/`sleep` directory.

> [!TIP]
> For best results:
> - Use PNG (with alpha channel for Page Overlay mode) or uncompressed BMP files with 24-bit color depth.
> - Use a resolution of 480×800 pixels to match the device's screen resolution.

## 4. Reading Mode

Once you have opened a book, the button layout changes to facilitate reading.

### Page Turning
| Action            | Buttons                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Previous Page** | Press **Left** _or_ **Volume Up**    |
| **Next Page**     | Press **Right** _or_ **Volume Down** |

The role of the volume (side) buttons can be swapped in the **[Controls Settings](#373-controls)**.

If the **Short Power Button Click** setting is set to "Page Turn", you can also turn to the next page by briefly pressing the Power button.

### Chapter Navigation
* **Next Chapter:** Press and **hold** the **Right** (or **Volume Down**) button briefly, then release.
* **Previous Chapter:** Press and **hold** the **Left** (or **Volume Up**) button briefly, then release.

This feature can be disabled in the **[Controls Settings](#373-controls)** to help avoid changing chapters by mistake.


### System Navigation
* **Return to Home:** Press the **Back** button to close the book and return to the **[Home](#31-home-screen)** screen.
* **Return to Browse Files:** Press and hold the **Back** button to close the book and return to the **[Browse Files](#33-browse-files-screen)** screen.
* **Reader Menu:** Press **Confirm** to open the reader menu, which includes: **[Table of Contents](#5-chapter-selection-screen)**, bookmarks, sync progress, reading statistics, quick per-book overrides (font, images, hyphenation, bionic reading…), take screenshot, and more.

### Supported Languages

Witch Reader renders text using the following Unicode character blocks, enabling support for a wide range of languages:

*   **Latin Script (Basic, Supplement, Extended-A):** Covers English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Turkish, and others.
*   **Cyrillic Script (Standard and Extended):** Covers Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Macedonian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, and others.

What is not supported: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and Farsi.

---

## 5. Chapter Selection Screen

Accessible by pressing **Confirm** while inside a book and selecting **Table of Contents**.

1.  Use **Left** (or **Volume Up**), or **Right** (or **Volume Down**) to highlight the desired chapter.
2.  Press **Confirm** to jump to that chapter.
3.  *Alternatively, press **Back** to cancel and return to your current page.*

---

## 6. Current Limitations & Roadmap

Please note that this firmware is currently in active development. The following features have known limitations:

* **Cover Images:** Large cover images embedded into EPUB require several seconds (~10s for ~2000 pixel tall image) to convert for the sleep screen and home screen thumbnail. Consider optimizing the EPUB with e.g. https://github.com/bigbag/epub-to-xtc-converter to speed this up.
* **Right-to-left scripts (Hebrew, Arabic):** Not currently supported. For BiDi / RTL support, use the original [CrossPoint](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader) firmware.
* **CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean):** Not supported. See https://github.com/aBER0724/crosspoint-reader-cjk for a CJK-capable fork.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Issues & Escaping Bootloop

If an issue or crash is encountered while using Witch Reader, feel free to raise an issue ticket and attach the serial monitor logs. The logs can be obtained by connecting the device to a computer and starting a serial monitor. Either [Serial Monitor](https://www.serialmonitor.org/) or the following command can be used:

```
pio device monitor
```

If the device is stuck in a bootloop, press and release the Reset button. Then, press and hold on to the configured Back button and the Power Button to boot to the Home Screen.

There can be issues with broken cache or config. In this case, delete the `.crosspoint` directory on your SD card (or consider deleting only `settings.json`, `state.json`, or `epub_*` cache directories in the `.crosspoint/` folder).
