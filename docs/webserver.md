# Web Server Guide

This guide explains how to connect your CrossPoint Reader to WiFi and use the built-in web server to upload files from your computer or phone.

## Overview

CrossPoint Reader includes a built-in web server that allows you to:

- Upload files wirelessly from any device on the same WiFi network
- Browse and manage files on your device's SD card
- Create folders to organize your library
- Rename, move and delete files and folders
- Change device settings, manage fonts, and view your reading stats
- Mount the card as a WebDAV drive (see [Other ways in](#other-ways-in))

## Prerequisites

- Your CrossPoint Reader device
- A WiFi network
- A computer, phone, or tablet connected to the **same WiFi network**

---

## Step 1: Starting the Web Server

1. On the Home screen, open **File Transfer**. If your Home screen does not show it, look under **More**.
2. Choose how to connect:
   - **Join a Network**: the device joins your WiFi (Step 2). Your computer or phone must be on the same network.
   - **Create Hotspot**: the device makes its own WiFi network, **CrossPoint-Reader**. Join it from your computer or phone; the screen shows the address to open.

The other entries on that screen (Calibre wireless, USB) are described in the [User Guide](../USER_GUIDE.md#36-file-transfer-screen).

## Step 2: Connecting to WiFi

### Viewing Available Networks

Once the scan completes, you'll see a list of available WiFi networks with the following indicators:

- **Signal strength bars** (`||||`, `|||`, `||`, `|`) - Shows connection quality
- **`*` symbol** - Indicates the network is password-protected (encrypted)
- **`+` symbol** - Indicates you have previously saved credentials for this network

### Selecting a Network

1. Use the **Left/Right** (or **Volume Up/Down**) buttons to navigate through the network list
2. Press **Confirm** to select the highlighted network

### Entering Password (for encrypted networks)

If the network requires a password:

1. An on-screen keyboard will appear
2. Use the navigation buttons to select characters
3. Press **Confirm** to enter each character
4. When complete, select the **Done** option on the keyboard

**Note:** If you've previously connected to this network, the saved password will be used automatically.

### Connection Process

The device will display "Connecting..." while establishing the connection. This typically takes 5-10 seconds.

### Saving Credentials

If this is a new network, you'll be prompted to save the password:

- Select **Yes** to save credentials for automatic connection next time (NOTE: These are stored in plaintext on the device's SD card. Do not use this for sensitive networks.)
- Select **No** to connect without saving

---

## Step 3: Connection Success

Once connected, the screen will display:

- **Network name** (SSID)
- **IP Address** (e.g., `192.168.1.102`)
- **Web server URL** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.102/`)

<img src="./images/wifi/wifi_connected.jpeg" height="500">

**Important:** Make note of the IP address - you'll need this to access the web interface from your computer or phone.

---

## Step 4: Accessing the Web Interface

### From a Computer

1. Ensure your computer is connected to the **same WiFi network** as your CrossPoint Reader
2. Open any web browser (Chrome is recommended)

   - Example: `http://192.168.1.102/`
4. Press Enter

### From a Phone or Tablet

1. Ensure your phone/tablet is connected to the **same WiFi network** as your CrossPoint Reader
2. Open your mobile browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.)
3. Type the IP address into the address bar
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.102/`
4. Tap Go

### Settings

The Settings page lists the same settings as the Settings screens on the device, grouped by
category. Change a value and save. Two cards at the end manage the **Wi-Fi Networks** and **OPDS
Servers** the device remembers. Saved passwords are never shown back; leave the password field
empty when editing to keep the stored one. See
[Web Settings](../USER_GUIDE.md#376-web-settings-wifi--opds) in the User Guide.

### Reading Stats

The Stats page shows your reading time, streaks and a list of books with per-book figures, the same
numbers as the Reading Stats screens on the device. From it you can **export** the history as a
`reading-stats.json` backup and **remove** a book from the stats.

### Font Manager

The Fonts page lists the font families installed on the SD card and the families available online.
You can install or update one or all of them (the device downloads them itself, so it needs internet
access), upload a `.cpfont` file from your computer, or delete a family.

### Plugins

Small add-ons kept on the SD card can add cards to the File Manager and Settings pages, for example
to edit a book's cover and metadata. They appear on their own once installed. See
[SD-card web plugins](./sd-plugins.md).

### Other ways in

- **WebDAV.** The card is also served over WebDAV at the same address, so you can mount
  `http://<device-ip>/` as a network drive in your file manager and copy files without the web page.
  Folders must be empty to delete.
- **curl and scripts.** See the next section.

---

## Command Line File Management

For power users, you can manage files directly from your terminal using `curl` while File Transfer is running. Detailed documentation can be found [here](./webserver-endpoints.md). 

## Security Notes

- The web server runs on port 80 (standard HTTP)
- **No authentication is required** - anyone on the same network can access the interface
- The web server is only accessible while the File Transfer screen shows it is running
- The web server automatically stops when you leave the File Transfer screen
- For security, only use on trusted private networks

---

## Technical Details

- **Supported WiFi:** 2.4GHz networks (802.11 b/g/n)
- **Web Server Port:** 80 (HTTP); fast uploads from the File Manager use a WebSocket on port 81
- **Maximum Upload Size:** Limited by available SD card space
- **Browser Compatibility:** All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

---

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Organize with folders** - Create folders before uploading to keep your library organized
2. **Check signal strength** - Stronger signals (`|||` or `||||`) provide faster, more reliable uploads
3. **Upload multiple files** - You can select and upload multiple files at once; the manager will queue them and refresh when the batch is finished
4. **Use descriptive names** - Name your folders clearly (e.g., "SciFi", "Mystery", "Non-Fiction")
5. **Keep credentials saved** - Save your WiFi password for quick reconnection in the future
6. **Exit when done** - Press **Back** to leave the File Transfer screen and save battery

---

## Stopping the Web Server

When you are finished:

1. Press the **Back** button on your CrossPoint Reader
2. The web server will automatically stop
3. WiFi will disconnect to conserve battery
4. You'll return to the previous screen

Your uploaded files will be immediately available in the file browser!
