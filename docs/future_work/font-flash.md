# Font flash and glyph-path speed

Status: open items as of 2026-10-07. Collected from the font-flash analysis of 2026-09-19 (removed in the 2026-10-07 docs cleanup; in git history).

Fonts are the largest part of the firmware image, so they are where flash headroom comes from. Every lever below except the first trades bytes for glyph-path CPU or RAM; measure that trade before changing a format (last item).

Already shipped, so nobody redoes it: the built-in glyph record went from 16 to 8 bytes by deriving `dataLength` and narrowing `left`/`top` (`f66c1a467`, −384 KB), then to 6 bytes by dropping `dataOffset` (`7779e1936`, −97,716 B); lookups return `EpdGlyphRef` by value and `epdResolveGlyph()` is the one place that tells built-in and `.cpfont` records apart. Size-invariant tables are shared across a family's sizes (`51707caae`, −226,560 B). Kerning is stored sparsely (`b16b4cb28`, −414,710 B) with split class maps (`30a3689e7`). Groups decode through a ring sized to their longest back-reference instead of whole (`bf39ecfcd`, ~4 KB peak for +2.1 % font data). Non-English UI languages ship compressed in a flash language pack (`e06754e18`, −232 KB). `GfxRenderer::truncatedText` truncates in one pass (`8b54d1c78`). The bitmap recompression survey found every alternative but brotli dead: zopfli tuning (−0.2 % for 30× the encode time), lzma2 (+1.7 %), zstd (−0.8 %), shared or trained preset dictionaries (+3.6 % to +6.2 %), byte-delta and bitplane pre-transforms (+32 %, +35 %), and per-glyph DEFLATE at any dictionary size (best case +41 %).

## `.cpfont` glyph record 16 → 10 bytes

**Open.** SD-card fonts still store the 16-byte `EpdGlyph` (`CPFONT_VERSION = 4`, `fontconvert_sdcard.py`). The built-in repack's two tricks apply: `dataLength` is derivable and `left`/`top` fit `int8_t`. `dataOffset` cannot shrink to 16 bits, because in a `.cpfont` it is an offset into a per-style bitmap section of up to ~170 KB, so it needs 24 bits.

**Why it matters.** Measured on Noto Sans 14, four styles (743,382 B): the glyph records are 112,448 B. A 10-byte record (24-bit offset) saves 42,168 B (5.7 %) per file; a 12-byte record with a 32-bit offset saves 28,112 B (3.8 %). That is SD space and download size, and less flash-cache partition per family.

**Where.** `SdCardFont`: the `static_assert(sizeof(EpdGlyph) == 16)`, the in-place read of glyph records from the flash mapping (`miniData.glyph` pointing at `mmapDataBase_ + glyphsFileOffset`, which relies on 16-byte records keeping each style's section 4-byte aligned), the per-page `miniGlyphs` reads and the overflow glyph read. `epdResolveGlyph()` and the `sdRecord` field of `EpdGlyphRef`.

**Constraints.** A narrower in-memory record cannot be mapped in place; copying it to the heap would cost ~8 KB per font on a device that reads at ~39 KB free. Read the 10-byte records with `memcpy` through `epdResolveGlyph()` instead. The format becomes version 5: `build-sd-fonts.py` regenerates the hosted families and the font download manager fetches them again, but hand-converted fonts would break, so the loader must keep accepting version 4 (today it rejects any version other than `CPFONT_VERSION`).

**Next step.** Teach the loader to accept both versions, add the version-5 record to `fontconvert_sdcard.py`, and check `glyph_lookup` and `reader_warm` in `env:bench_font` stay flat.

## A packed-glyph cache that outlives one page

**Open.** Decoded glyphs live in per-page slots that each prewarm refills, plus a 4-slot fallback cache (`FontDecompressor::FALLBACK_CACHE_SLOTS`). UI screens never prewarm, so a UI face that missed would thrash those four slots on every repaint. That is why the UI faces ship uncompressed.

**Why it matters.** The cache was the biggest win in crosspoint-reader PR #3083 (681 → 385 ms a page, pages decoding nothing at all), and it is independent of how the bitmaps are stored: it would speed up today's DEFLATE groups and SD fonts, where a thrashing glyph ring is a measured multi-second cost on the font preview screen. Made global rather than reader-scoped, it is the precondition for compressing the UI faces, for brotli on the UI path, or for a per-glyph codec. A compressed UI face without it would sit in the cold regime: 2,796 µs a glyph against 3.7 µs warm (X3, 2026-09-19), about 84 ms of extra compose on a menu screen.

**Where.** `FontDecompressor` (page slots, fallback slots), `FontCacheManager`.

**Cost.** About 8–10 KB of RAM resident for the session. As a permanent block it has to be allocated at a stable point before anything is released (see [Memory Allocation Strategy §4](../memory-allocation-strategy.md#4-where-each-consumer-lands)); on the X3, which reads at 30–41 KB free, that is the hard part.

**Next step.** Decide whether 8–10 KB of permanent heap is affordable on the X3. If it is, prototype it allocated at boot and measure `reader_cold`, `reader_warm` and Home/Settings compose time.

## Brotli for glyph bitmaps

**Open.** Brotli at quality 11 with a 64 KB window (`lgwin=16`) is the only bitmap recompression that beat zopfli DEFLATE: −95 KB gross. The decoder costs ~25–40 KB of flash, so the net gain is −55 to −70 KB, for a second decoder on the font path and more CPU per cold glyph.

**Why it matters.** Flash headroom; the image was at 94.8 % of the app partition after `7779e1936` (2026-09-20).

**Ruled out.** Porting crosspoint-reader PR #3083's GlyphStream codec (per-glyph range coding, ~−650 KB on our bitmaps): it was still a draft, its render cost was +107 % before caching, and the Home screen regressed from 14 to 70 ms because its cache was reader-scoped. It would need the global glyph cache first.

**Next step.** Only after the global glyph cache, or for reader faces only: build a decode-only brotli, measure its real flash cost, and compare `reader_cold` and `reader_prewarm` against DEFLATE.

## Kerning lookups are a cache problem

**Open.** On the X3 a kern lookup costs about 2.8 glyph lookups: 3,052 ns a pair on `inter_ui_12`, 63 % of UI text measurement (2026-09-19). The cost tracks the kern table's working set (10 KB for Inter UI against the C3's 16 KB flash cache), not the number of binary-search probes.

**Why it matters.** Little, today. The panel is 92–95 % of every screen update (compose 22–40 ms against a 435 ms FAST refresh), so the whole font path is a few ms of a ~475 ms frame. It would matter if compose ever ran at the low-power CPU clock, where 22 ms becomes ~350 ms.

**Options, none built.** Memoize the codepoint → kern class lookups per font (512 B of `.bss`; judged not worth a permanent cut of the heap ceiling for 2–3 ms of a 475 ms frame); restructure the tables to stay cache-resident (generator work, unknown flash cost); skip kerning for UI text (a visible change, and `drawText()` kerns too, so both paths would change together).

**Next step.** None until compose time is visible. If it becomes so, start with the memo and measure `kerning` and `text_measure` in `env:bench_font`.

## Measure before changing the format

**Open.** Any lever above trades bytes for CPU, and crosspoint-reader PR #3083 stalled because nobody could measure that trade on a device. The instruments exist; the baselines are thin.

**Where.**
- `env:bench_font` (`bench/font_main.cpp`): the font layer on a C3 with no framebuffer or panel. `glyph_lookup`, `kerning`, `text_measure`, `ui_bitmap_fetch`, `reader_cold`, `reader_prewarm` and `reader_warm` for `inter_ui_12`, `inter_ui_14` and `notosans_14`. `pio run -e bench_font -t upload`, then `pio device monitor -e bench_font`. It replaces the firmware; flash `env:default` back afterwards.
- The reader's render benchmark (`EpubReaderActivity::runRenderBenchmark`, reader menu "Render Benchmark"): ten page turns each way with per-phase timings and font cache counters. Compiled out unless `-DENABLE_BENCHMARKS=1`.
- UI screens: only the `Time = … ms from clearScreen to displayBuffer` debug line, which is the whole compose and cannot separate the font path.

**Baselines.** X3 only: the 2026-09-19 capture before the repack, and the after-repack numbers in the message of `f66c1a467`. No X4 or S3 numbers.

**Next step.** Before starting any lever here, run `env:bench_font` on the X3 and the X4 at current master and put the numbers in the PR next to the after-change run, together with Home and Settings compose times.
