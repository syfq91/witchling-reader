# EPUB TOC Anchor Navigation

This document describes how the reader handles EPUB Table of Contents (TOC) entries that use fragment anchors to point into spine files, enabling navigation to sub-chapters within a single XHTML file.

## Background: EPUB spine and TOC structure

An EPUB's **spine** is an ordered list of XHTML files that define reading order. The **TOC** (table of contents) maps chapter names to positions in the spine, optionally with fragment anchors (e.g. `chapter1.xhtml#section-5`).

Two layouts are relevant here:

- **1:1** -- one TOC entry per spine item (most common, no anchors needed)
- **Multi-TOC-per-spine** -- multiple TOC entries point into a single spine file using fragment anchors (e.g. Moby Dick from Project Gutenberg packs 3-9 chapters per file)

Spine items before the first TOC entry (cover pages) and after the last (appendices, copyright) have no TOC entry of their own.

## BookMetadataCache and TOC-to-spine mapping

`BookMetadataCache` builds the mapping between spine items and TOC entries at epub open time. Key details:

- Each `SpineEntry` has a `tocIndex` field set during cache building. For spines with no matching TOC entry, `tocIndex` inherits the previous spine's value (`lastSpineTocIndex`). This means orphan spines (cover pages, appendices) are treated as continuations of the nearest preceding chapter.
- `getTocIndexForSpineIndex(i)` returns the stored `tocIndex` for spine `i` -- a file seek into BookMetadataCache, not computed on the fly.
- `getTocItem(i)` returns the TOC entry (title, spineIndex, anchor) for TOC index `i` -- also a file seek per call, not cached in memory. Code that queries TOC metadata in a loop should cache the results locally first.
- `getSpineIndexForTocIndex(i)` does the reverse lookup (TOC index to spine index).

### Cached TOC reliability flag

`hasReliableToc()` answers whether the TOC has enough spine coverage (>=25% of spines referenced) to drive chapter UX, with short-circuits for `tocCount <= 0` and the "large book with one TOC entry" pathology.

The result is computed once during `buildBookBin` (folded into the existing `spineIndex->tocIndex` scan, so no extra disk pass) and persisted as a single byte in book.bin's header A. `Epub::hasReliableToc()` reads `BookMetadataCache::isTocReliable()` and caches the bool in `tocReliabilityState`.

This matters because the check used to recompute the answer on demand by calling `getTocEntry(i)` for every TOC entry, which does two SD-card seeks per call. On a 2858-entry web-novel TOC that was ~5700 seeks (~7 seconds) added to first-page latency. `BOOK_CACHE_VERSION` was bumped for this layout change; an older cache is rebuilt on next open.

## Section cache file format

The section cache (`.bin`) stores pre-rendered page data for a spine item. The file layout:

```
[header: version, render parameters, status byte (parse complete + degraded flags), pageCount,
         pageLut / anchorMap / pageBreakMap / paragraphLut offsets]
[serialized pages...]
[page LUT: array of uint32_t file offsets, one per page]
[anchor map: uint16_t count, then (string, uint16_t) pairs]
[page break map: uint16_t count, then (uint16_t pageIndex, string label) pairs]
[paragraph LUT: uint16_t count, then per page uint32 visibleTextOffset, uint16 paragraphIndex, uint16 listItemIndex]
```

[file-formats.md](file-formats.md#sectionbin) has the field-by-field header table.

The header size is defined by `header::kSize` (computed from the per-field `header::*` offsets) and validated with a `static_assert` in `Section::writeSectionFileHeader`. Several functions read the header independently and must stay in sync:

- `loadSectionFile` -- full section load, reads header + builds TOC boundaries from anchor map
- `getPageForAnchor` -- seeks directly to anchor map offset from header
- the page-break-map and paragraph-LUT readers -- seek to their own header offsets
- `writeSectionFileHeader` -- writes the header during cache creation

When modifying the header layout, bump `SECTION_FILE_VERSION` to invalidate stale caches and update all read paths.

## Anchor-to-page mapping

### Recording anchors during parsing

`ChapterHtmlSlimParser` records every HTML `id` attribute and its corresponding page number into `anchorData` (a flat `std::vector<std::pair<std::string, uint16_t>>`). Recording is deferred via `pendingAnchorId` until `startNewTextBlock()`, after the previous text block is flushed to pages via `makePages()`. This ensures `completedPageCount` reflects the correct page.

On the normal path the records are spilled to a scratch file on the SD card as they are recorded, and `Section::createSectionFile` copies them into the section cache when the build ends (`copyAnchorSpill`). The resident vector only holds them if the spill file cannot be opened. The serialized map is the same either way.

For TOC anchors specifically, `startNewTextBlock` also forces a page break before recording, so chapters start on fresh pages rather than mid-page. The parser receives the set of TOC anchor strings via `tocAnchors` (a `std::vector<std::string>`) from `Section::createSectionFile`.

### On-disk format

The anchor data is serialized at the end of the section cache file (`.bin`), after the page LUT. The header stores the anchor map offset. Format:

```
[uint16_t count]
[string anchor_1][uint16_t page_1]
[string anchor_2][uint16_t page_2]
...
```

This data serves two purposes:
- **Footnote navigation** (`getPageForAnchor`): on-demand linear scan for a single anchor
- **TOC boundary resolution** (`buildTocBoundariesFromFile`): scan matching only TOC anchors

### Data structure choices

All anchor storage uses flat vectors, not `std::map` or `std::set`. On the ESP32-C3, each `std::map`/`std::set` node requires its own heap allocation, causing fragmentation. Vectors use a single contiguous allocation. The entry counts are small enough (typically 1-10 TOC anchors per spine, dozens to hundreds of total anchors) that linear scans are faster than tree lookups at these sizes.

## TOC boundaries in Section

When a section is loaded or created, `Section` builds an in-memory `tocBoundaries` vector mapping each TOC entry in that spine to its start page. This is a small vector (1-3 entries typically) that enables O(1) lookups without file I/O.

### Two build paths

**From in-memory anchors** (`buildTocBoundaries`): Called after `createSectionFile` when the parser's anchor vector is still in memory. Iterates TOC entries and does linear scans against the anchor vector.

**From disk** (`buildTocBoundariesFromFile`): Called from `loadSectionFile` when loading a cached section. Caches the small set of TOC anchor strings first (since `getTocItem()` does file I/O to `BookMetadataCache`), then streams through on-disk anchors matching only those, stopping early once all are resolved. Uses a reusable `std::string` buffer to avoid per-entry heap allocation.

The two functions are kept separate because their iteration patterns differ fundamentally: in-memory iterates TOC entries with inner scans of anchors, while the disk path iterates disk entries with inner scans of the small TOC anchor set.

### Early exit optimization

If no TOC entries in the spine have anchors (`unresolvedCount == 0`), both functions return immediately without storing any boundaries. `getTocIndexForPage` falls back to `epub->getTocIndexForSpineIndex`, which gives the correct answer for the common 1:1 case.

### Query methods

- `getTocIndexForPage(page)` -- binary search on sorted `tocBoundaries` to find which chapter a page belongs to
- `getPageForTocIndex(tocIndex)` -- linear scan to find a chapter's start page
- `getPageRangeForTocIndex(tocIndex)` -- returns `[startPage, endPage)` range for a chapter within this spine

All are in-memory, no file I/O.

## Chapter navigation in EpubReaderActivity

### Chapter skip (long-press)

Navigates by TOC index, not spine index. Uses `getTocIndexForPage` to determine the current chapter, then increments or decrements.

- **Same-spine skip**: Resolves the target page via `getPageForTocIndex` entirely in memory
- **Cross-spine skip**: Sets `pendingTocIndex` (a `std::optional<int>`) which is resolved after the target section loads in `render()`
- **Forward past last TOC entry**: Jumps to end-of-book (spine index clamped in `render()`)
- **Backward before first TOC entry**: Jumps to the spine before the current chapter's first spine (clamped to 0 in `render()`)
- **No TOC entry for spine** (`curTocIndex < 0`): Falls back to spine-level skip

### Chapter selector

The chapter selection activity receives `currentTocIndex` (per-page, not per-spine) so it highlights the correct sub-chapter. Returns `ChapterResult` with both `spineIndex` and `std::optional<int> tocIndex`. The reader resolves the page via `getPageForTocIndex` for same-spine navigation or defers via `pendingTocIndex` for cross-spine.

### Footnote navigation

Uses the existing `pendingAnchor` mechanism from the footnote anchor navigation commit (4d222567). `getPageForAnchor` does an on-demand linear scan of the on-disk anchor data. This is separate from TOC boundaries -- it reads all anchors (not just TOC ones) and is only called for footnote jumps.

### Status bar

Uses `getTocIndexForPage()` for the chapter title, so the status bar shows the correct sub-chapter name when reading a multi-TOC-per-spine file.

## Orphan spine handling

Spine items without a TOC entry inherit the previous spine's `tocIndex` in `BookMetadataCache`. This means:

- Pre-TOC spines (cover pages) may have `tocIndex == -1` if they're before any chapter
- Post-TOC spines (appendices, copyright) inherit the last chapter's `tocIndex`

The chapter skip logic guards against `curTocIndex < 0` and falls back to spine-level navigation.

## Implementation pitfalls and edge cases

### Anchor recording timing

The `pendingAnchorId` deferred recording pattern is critical for correctness. Anchors must be recorded *after* `makePages()` flushes the previous text block (so `completedPageCount` reflects the right page) but the TOC page break must happen *before* recording (so the anchor lands on the new page). Both of these happen inside `startNewTextBlock()`. An earlier design used a `recordAnchor` lambda called at various points in `startElement()`, but this had wrong timing for headings and block elements -- `startNewTextBlock` would consume `pendingAnchorId` before `recordAnchor` could force the page break. Moving all page-break logic into `startNewTextBlock` fixed this.

### pendingAnchorId overwrite on consecutive elements

If two elements with `id` attributes appear before any `startNewTextBlock` call (e.g. nested divs), the second `id` overwrites `pendingAnchorId` and the first anchor is never recorded. This is a known limitation inherited from the footnote anchor navigation commit (4d222567) on master. In practice, TOC anchors are on chapter headings which trigger `startNewTextBlock`, so this doesn't affect TOC navigation.

### wordsExtractedInBlock reset on empty block reuse

When `startNewTextBlock` reuses an empty text block (the early-return path), `wordsExtractedInBlock` must be reset to 0. Without this, footnotes in the reused block could be assigned to wrong pages based on stale word counts from a prior block.

### getTocItem() does file I/O

`epub->getTocItem()` reads from `BookMetadataCache` via file seek on every call. This is why `buildTocBoundariesFromFile` caches the TOC anchor strings into a small vector before entering the disk scan loop -- otherwise the inner loop would do file I/O (BookMetadataCache) for every on-disk anchor entry.

### Defensive sort on tocBoundaries

`tocBoundaries` is sorted by `startPage` after building. In well-formed EPUBs, entries are already in order (TOC follows document order). The sort is a safety net for malformed EPUBs where TOC entries might be out of document order. With 1-3 entries it has no measurable cost.

## Test epub

`scripts/generate_spine_toc_edges_epub.py` generates `test/epubs/test_spine_toc_edges.epub`, a purpose-built epub that exercises spine/TOC relationship patterns. See the script header for the full list of edge cases covered.

## Printed-page labels (status bar hint)

The status bar can show the printed-book page number for the current rendered page in addition to the device-relative `currentPage/pageCount` counter, e.g. `(42) 137/305  18%`. The printed-page label is sourced from the EPUB itself; the device counter remains authoritative for spine pagination.

### Three input formats

The reader accepts printed-page data from three places, in priority order:

1. **Inline `doc-pagebreak` markers** in the XHTML (EPUB 3 accessibility convention): any element with `role="doc-pagebreak"` or `epub:type="pagebreak"`. The visible label is read from `aria-label`, falling back to `title`, falling back to the NCX/nav/page-map label if cross-referenced.
2. **EPUB 3 `<nav epub:type="page-list">`** in the nav document (`TocNavParser`).
3. **NCX `<pageList>`** (EPUB 2 extension) and **`page-map.xml`** (EPUB 2.01, a separate top-level manifest item with media-type `application/oebps-page-map+xml`), both parsed by `TocNcxParser` / `PageMapParser`.

Only one of (2), (3a), or (3b) writes the cache file `<book-cache>/pagelist.bin`. The nav parser runs first; the NCX page-list is written only if the nav parser found nothing. The page-map parser runs last and is skipped if `pagelist.bin` already exists. Inline `doc-pagebreak` markers always take effect in addition to the cache file (they are matched at chapter parse time, independent of the cache).

### pagelist.bin format

Written once per book at index time; consumed once per section build. Format:

```text
[uint16_t entryCount]
[String href][String anchor][String label]    // repeated entryCount times
```

`href` is the normalised spine href (e.g. `OEBPS/c9_split_000.xhtml`). `anchor` is the fragment id (empty for "start of file"). `label` is the visible printed-page label (e.g. `"42"`, `"iv"`).

### Section parse path

When `Section::createSectionFile` runs for a chapter, it streams `pagelist.bin`, filters to entries whose `href` matches the current spine item, and passes the resulting `(anchor → label)` pairs to `ChapterHtmlSlimParser::setExternalPageBreakAnchors`. During parsing, an element whose `id=` matches a known external anchor is treated as if it carried an inline `doc-pagebreak` marker — the existing `recordPageBreakLabel()` path is reused. The NCX/nav/page-map "start of file" entries (empty anchor) emit their label on the very first element of the chapter.

### Section cache storage

The section cache file (`section.bin`) gained a `pageBreakMap` block: `uint16_t count`, then for each entry `uint16_t pageIndex` + `String label`. The header carries a `pageBreakMapOffset` between `anchorMapOffset` and `paragraphLutOffset`. On reload, `Section::buildPageBreakLabelsFromFile` populates `pageBreakLabels` for status-bar queries.

### Status bar lookup

`Section::getPrintedPageLabelForPage(devicePage)` returns the parenthesised label (e.g. `"(42)"`) for the rendered device page if one or more printed-page anchors land on it. When several labels co-occur on a single device page (short page contains both `page_7` and `page_8`), the result collapses to `"(7/8)"`. Returns `nullopt` when no printed-page anchor falls on this exact device page — in that case the status bar shows only the device counter.

### Sleep overlay lookup

`Section::getPrintedPageLabelFromCache(bookCachePath, spineIndex, page)` is a standalone helper used by `SleepActivity` — it reads the printed-page label directly from `section.bin`'s page-break map without instantiating a `Section` or supplying render parameters. It looks in that spine's bucket of the sections cache (`Epub::spineCacheDir`), finds any cache variant for `spineIndex` (all variants share the same printed-page anchors since those are content-derived), reads its `pageBreakMap` block, and returns the same `"(42)"` formatting as the in-memory query. The function is version-guarded against `SECTION_FILE_VERSION` so a cache from a different layout is skipped silently. Cost: one extra `section.bin` open per sleep entry, skipped when no cache exists.

### "Jump to printed page" navigation

The reader menu exposes a `STR_GO_TO_PRINTED_PAGE` entry, gated on the book having at least one integer-parseable label in `pagelist.bin` (roman-only or empty page lists hide the menu item). Selecting it opens `EpubReaderPrintedPageInputActivity`, a numeric input dialog:

- Up/Down adjust the digit under the cursor by ±1 (with carry). PageBack/PageForward mirror Up/Down so the physical page-turn buttons still work.
- Left/Right move the cursor between digits.
- Confirm returns a `PrintedPageResult { std::string label }`; Back cancels.
- Pre-fills with the printed-page label currently shown on the status bar (stripped of parens), falling back to the lowest integer label in the book.
- Shows the valid integer range underneath ("Range: 1 - 305") and a step hint.

On confirmation, `EpubReaderActivity` resolves the typed label by linear scan through the loaded `pagelist.bin` entries to recover `(href, anchor)`, calls `Epub::resolveHrefToSpineIndex` to get the target spine, and sets `navTarget = NavigationTarget::makeAnchor(anchor)` (or `makePage(0)` for top-of-file entries). The existing anchor-jump infrastructure in the renderer then handles the actual page-resolution and section load. Labels that exist in the dialog's integer range but skip in the book's `pagelist.bin` (e.g. publisher omitted page 17) are logged at DBG and the reader stays put — no navigation happens.

## Performance characteristics

- **Per page turn**: All in-memory. `getTocIndexForPage` (binary search on 1-3 entries), `getTocItem` for title (one file seek to BookMetadataCache -- noted as a future optimization opportunity).
- **Section load**: One file open for the section cache. `buildTocBoundariesFromFile` scans the anchor map for a few TOC entries with early exit.
- **Footnote navigation**: One additional file open to scan the anchor map for a single anchor.
- **1:1 TOC-to-spine (common case)**: No overhead. `unresolvedCount == 0`, `tocBoundaries` stays empty, all queries fall back to spine-level methods.
