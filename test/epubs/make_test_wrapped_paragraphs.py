"""Build test_wrapped_paragraphs.epub — the corpus book for the PARAGRAPH ANCHOR.

Every other fixture in this corpus puts its <p> elements directly inside <body>.
Real books mostly do not: Calibre (and therefore a large share of commercial EPUBs)
wraps a chapter's content in a container div —

    <body class="calibre"><div class="chapter"><p>...</p>...</div></body>

— and the section cache's paragraph LUT only counts <p> at body-child level, so a
wrapped chapter records paragraph index 0 on every page. That is the shape the
reader's "return from a footnote", "keep my place across a relayout" and KOReader
XPath sync all anchor on, and none of the existing fixtures can see it.

Spine 0 is the wrapped chapter, spine 1 the same prose unwrapped as the control.
Both are long enough to span several pages at the test's viewport.
