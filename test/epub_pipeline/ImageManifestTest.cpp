// Image dimensions behind a large JPEG metadata block (witchhunt-reader #249).
//
// The image manifest probes the first 4 KB of an entry. A Photoshop-style export carries
// EXIF + IPTC + XMP + ICC in front of the frame header — ~29 KB in the reporter's book — so
// the probe never reaches SOF. Finding it then means a streaming walk of the DEFLATED entry
// through an inflate ring sized to the entry (up to 32 KB), which is exactly the block the
// C3 cannot promise mid-parse: the reporter's image sits on page 54 of a 58-page chapter,
// where the heap is at its most fragmented. When that ring failed, the image was cached as
// alt text for good, indistinguishable from a corrupt file.
//
// What has to hold:
//   1. A JPEG whose SOF lies beyond the probe window is DEFERRED — it is neither resolved nor
//      written off as unreadable.
//   2. A deferred image can be resolved later (resolvePending), once, and persists like any
//      other entry, so the walk is paid once per image per book.
//   3. Mid-parse, the walk runs only when contiguous heap actually covers its ring; a refusal
//      is latched as provisional (the build can be discarded and redone), never cached.
//   4. Resolving the pending images at build end makes the next build of the same section
//      clean — the mechanism the reader uses to show the image after one rebuild.
