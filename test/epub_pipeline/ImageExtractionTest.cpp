// Lazy image extraction (ImageBlock::ensureExtracted -> Epub::extractItemToFile).
//
// The inflate ring this path needs is up to 32 KB CONTIGUOUS, and until it could be served
// from an arena it was the first allocation to fail on a fragmented heap: measured on X4 at
// contig=13300, every image on the page logged "Failed to init inflate reader" and rendered
// as nothing at all. The reader is already holding a borrowed 48 KB arena for the decoders at
// that moment (image_scratch), so the fix is to hand it to the extractor too.
//
// What has to hold:
//   1. The arena path produces exactly the same bytes as the heap path.
//   2. The ring really comes from the arena, and is given back afterwards.
//   3. An arena too small to serve the reader falls back to the heap instead of failing —
//      EntryReader itself does NOT fall back once it has been handed one.
