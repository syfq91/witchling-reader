// The contract that makes EpdFontGroup::ringBytes safe to trust.
//
// A group is no longer inflated into a buffer of its uncompressed size; it is streamed through
// a ring of ringBytes and each glyph is compacted out of the passing bytes. That is only sound
// if two things hold, and both are checked here against real shipped font data rather than a
// synthetic stream:
//
//   1. ringBytes is SUFFICIENT — every group decodes byte-for-byte through a ring that size.
//   2. ringBytes is HONEST — it is genuinely smaller than the group for the big groups, which
//      is the entire reason the field exists. A converter that quietly emitted
//      ringBytes == uncompressedSize would pass (1) while delivering nothing.
//
// And the failure mode is checked too: a ring that is too small must be REFUSED, not decoded
// into garbage. uzlib returns TINF_DICT_ERROR for a back-reference that outruns the ring, so a
// mis-generated font cannot silently render wrong pixels.
