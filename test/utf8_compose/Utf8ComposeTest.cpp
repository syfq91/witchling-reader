// utf8NfcNorm composition.
//
// The function started as a Vietnamese-only helper: a base letter followed by combining
// marks, folded into the precomposed U+1EA0-U+1EF9 range. Conjoining Hangul jamo need the
// same treatment for the same reason -- the fonts carry precomposed syllables and nothing
// else -- but they are not combining marks, so neither the fast-path check nor the absorb
// loop saw them and Korean stored in NFD came through as jamo the fonts cannot draw.
// macOS writes every filename that way, and some EPUBs carry their text that way.
//
// Hangul composition is arithmetic (Unicode 3.12), not a table, so the cases below are
// chosen to pin the arithmetic rather than to sample a list: both syllable shapes, the
// boundaries of each jamo block, and the sequences that must NOT compose.
// crosspoint-reader PR #3036.
