.SYNOPSIS
  Flash the firmware that is ALREADY built, without going through PlatformIO.

.DESCRIPTION
  `pio run -t upload` spends a minute or two re-scanning the project and the
  library dependency graph before it reaches esptool. That is wasted whenever
  the binary has not changed -- most often when a long build finished while the
  device was asleep, the upload failed for want of a port, and all you want is
  to power the device on and push the same image again.

  This calls esptool directly on the artifacts already in .pio\build\<env>, so
  it starts writing immediately.

  NOTE: it writes the same four images at the same four offsets as a PlatformIO
  upload, which deliberately leaves the gap at 0x9000 alone -- that is the NVS
  partition, where settings live. Do NOT "simplify" this by flashing
  firmware.factory.bin at 0x0: that image spans 0x0-0x10000 and pads the NVS
  window with 0xFF, so it would wipe the user's settings on every flash.
